# Neuronal_Networks
There are four scripts:

  The first one is a neuronal network that recognizes handwritten digits. For learning and evaluation the mnist database is used. Finally, some single example are         provided to test the model. The code is specially tailored for that propose!
  
  The second script is a neuronal network model with two decision layers that recognizes from 10 different fashion labels. Also the mnist database is used.

  The third and foruth are models that predicts whether a statement ins sarcastic or not. It reads in a .json file with labeled statements. A naive Bayes Bernoulli         classifier is compared to a neuronal network built with keras/tensorflow.

# Neuronal_Networks
There are three scripts:

  The first one is a neuronal network that recognizes handwritten digits. For learning and evaluation the minst database is used. Finally, some single example are         provided to test the model. The code is specially tailored for that propose!
  
  The second script is a neuronal network model with two decision layers that recognizes from 10 different fashion labels. Also the minst database is used.

  The third one is a model that predicts whether a statement ins sarcastic or not. It reads in a .json file with labeled statements. The words are tokenized and a         neuronal network with keras/tensorflow is build.
